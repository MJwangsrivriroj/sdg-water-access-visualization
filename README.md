# SDG Water Access Visualization 🌍  
Visualization of **UN SDG 6.1.1 — Access to Safely Managed Drinking Water**.  
This project analyzes and visualizes global data on drinking water access, showing disparities between regions, trends over time, and urban–rural differences.

## 📊 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to visualize progress toward **Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6.1.1**, which measures the percentage of the population using safely managed drinking water services.

### Visualizations Included
1. **Global Map** – Access to safely managed drinking water by country (2022)  
2. **Progress Over Time** – Changes in water access for selected countries  
3. **Urban vs. Rural Comparison** – Disparities in water access by area type

## 🧠 Key Insights
- Developed countries generally show >90% access.
- Sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Asia still lag behind 50%.
- Urban areas tend to have better access than rural areas.
